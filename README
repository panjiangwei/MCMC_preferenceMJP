Matlab code for MCMC inference of MJP and preference-MJP models in paper:

"Markov-modulated Marked Poisson Processes for Check-in Data",
by Jiangwei Pan, Vinayak Rao, Pankaj K. Agarwal, Alan E. Gelfand,
in ICML 2016.

The code uses check-in data as an example.  The models can be applied to 
other types of time-stamped sequence data.

Inference:
- run mjp_mcmc.m for MJP
- run preference_mjp_mcmc.m for preference-MJP

Both files uses parallelization with "parfor" when calling "sample_mjp_path"
function.  You can replace it with "for" if you do not want parallelization.

Visualization: after inference, visualize the states by running 
visualize_states.m

Input format:
- contains cell array "data = cell(U, 1)" of U sequences
- data{u}.loc: 2 * n vector, locations (lon, lat) of observations
- data{u}.t: 1 * n vector, times of observations (normalized in [0,1])
- see "sample_checkin_data.mat" for an example
